# git-homework

This repository is created as part of a Git homework assignment. The project showcases various Git operations such as repository initialization, branching, merge conflict resolution, and using Git stash.

The repository includes the following:
- **README.md**: Project description.
- **LICENSE.md**: License for the project.
- **.gitignore**: Ignored files for the project.
- **INSTALL.md**: Installation instructions.
                  Refer to [Installation Guide](INSTALL.md)
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Guidelines for contributing.
- **CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md**: Code of conduct for project contributors.
- **Team Webpage (index.html)**: A simple HTML webpage describing the project team, which includes the team number, all team members' names, and email addresses (with clickable email links). The webpage also features a footer.

Throughout the project, various Git tasks are demonstrated:
- Adding email links to the webpage and committing changes.
- Creating a "feature" branch to add a footer to the webpage.
- Simulating and resolving a merge conflict by making conflicting changes to the footer in different branches.
- Stashing changes and applying them later in the workflow.
